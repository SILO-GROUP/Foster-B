# Foster B

This is a prototyping surface for Foster, which is a Rex project.

Foster generates a cross-compiler and then cross-compiles a linux installer image from raw sources.

This is Variant B of this effort.

This project is a part of a series of projects intended to create SURRO Linux.

## Ownership

This project is owned by SILO GROUP and Christopher Punches, and was authored in 2021.  All rights reserved:

While a Linux distribution itself can't be more restrictive than the GPL, the data, designs, and automations used to generate it can be.  This meets that criteria and should be considered proprietary unless released as otherwise.

This data and code is open source, but it is not currently considered "free software".
